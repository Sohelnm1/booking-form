## Invoice Generation Process

### 1. Booking Payment Success

```php
// In BookingController::paymentSuccess()
$booking->update([
    'status' => 'confirmed',
    'payment_status' => 'paid',
    'payment_method' => 'razorpay',
    'transaction_id' => $request->razorpay_payment_id,
]);

// Create invoice automatically
$booking->createOrUpdateInvoice();
```

### 2. Reschedule Payment Success

```php
// In CustomerController::reschedulePaymentSuccess()
$booking->update([
    'reschedule_payment_amount' => $rescheduleData['reschedule_fee'],
    'reschedule_payment_id' => $request->razorpay_payment_id,
    'reschedule_payment_date' => now(),
    'reschedule_payment_status' => 'paid',
]);

// Create or update invoice
$booking->createOrUpdateInvoice();
```

### 3. Invoice Creation Logic

```php
// Invoice::createFromBooking()
public static function createFromBooking(Booking $booking, string $type = 'booking'): self
{
    $invoiceItems = [
        [
            'description' => $booking->service->name,
            'quantity' => 1,
            'unit_price' => $booking->service->price,
            'total' => $booking->service->price,
            'type' => 'service'
        ]
    ];

    // Add extras
    foreach ($booking->extras as $extra) {
        $invoiceItems[] = [
            'description' => $extra->name,
            'quantity' => 1,
            'unit_price' => $extra->pivot->price,
            'total' => $extra->pivot->price,
            'type' => 'extra'
        ];
    }

    // Add reschedule fee if applicable
    if ($booking->reschedule_payment_amount > 0) {
        $invoiceItems[] = [
            'description' => 'Reschedule Fee',
            'quantity' => 1,
            'unit_price' => $booking->reschedule_payment_amount,
            'total' => $booking->reschedule_payment_amount,
            'type' => 'reschedule_fee'
        ];
    }

    $subtotal = collect($invoiceItems)->sum('total');
    $discountAmount = $booking->discount_amount ?? 0;
    $rescheduleFee = $booking->reschedule_payment_amount ?? 0;
    $totalAmount = $subtotal - $discountAmount + $rescheduleFee;

    return self::create([
        'invoice_number' => self::generateInvoiceNumber(),
        'booking_id' => $booking->id,
        'user_id' => $booking->user_id,
        'invoice_type' => $type,
        'subtotal' => $subtotal,
        'discount_amount' => $discountAmount,
        'reschedule_fee' => $rescheduleFee,
        'total_amount' => $totalAmount,
        'currency' => 'INR',
        'payment_method' => $booking->payment_method,
        'transaction_id' => $booking->transaction_id,
        'payment_status' => $booking->payment_status,
        'payment_date' => $booking->payment_status === 'paid' ? now() : null,
        'coupon_code' => $booking->coupon_code,
        'coupon_discount' => $discountAmount,
        'status' => $booking->payment_status === 'paid' ? 'paid' : 'pending',
        'issued_date' => now(),
        'due_date' => now()->addDays(7),
        'paid_date' => $booking->payment_status === 'paid' ? now() : null,
        'invoice_items' => $invoiceItems,
        'payment_history' => [
            [
                'date' => now()->toISOString(),
                'status' => $booking->payment_status,
                'amount' => $totalAmount,
                'transaction_id' => $booking->transaction_id,
                'method' => $booking->payment_method
            ]
        ]
    ]);
}
```

    $lastInvoice = self::where('invoice_number', 'like', "INV-{$year}{$month}-%")
        ->orderBy('invoice_number', 'desc')
        ->first();

    if ($lastInvoice) {
        // Extract the sequence number and increment
        $parts = explode('-', $lastInvoice->invoice_number);
        $sequence = intval($parts[2]) + 1;
    } else {
